# TODO:

- Choose a color scheme
- Later, change all Lorem Ipsum text to something relevant

# DONE:

- Navbar on larger screens(bigger than md I believe) should not be a Hamburger Menu
- Make Sold Items Responsive (maybe include masonry grid)
- Fetch API in Sold Items
- Change the CurrentlyListedCard description (maybe instead of " Listed Today at " we put the price, and instead of the Price we put and view anchor tag)
