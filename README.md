# TODO:

- Choose a color scheme
- Later, change all Lorem Ipsum text to something relevant

<br>

# DONE:

- Navbar on larger screens (bigger than md I believe) should not be a Hamburger Menu
- Make Sold Items Responsive (maybe include masonry grid)
- Fetch API in Sold Items
- Change the CurrentlyListedCard description (maybe instead of " Listed Today at " we put the price, and instead of the Price we put a "view" anchor tag)
- Change the `Ads.jsx` pictures and text.
- Show featured auction container with a scrollbar on desktop devices (did this for all devices)
- Change the `FeaturedItemCard.jsx` description to a countdown (daisyUI). -> Couldn't implement daisyUI as it would brick everything that I already have. I just set it up for a API-based countdown (if possible)
- Make the `CurrentlyListedCard.jsx` text bigger and bigger padding on desktop.
